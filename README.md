# 🔍 Barcode-Based Augmented Reality with AR.js & A-Frame

This project is a modular, browser-based augmented reality (AR) experience using **AR.js** and **A-Frame**. It tracks a specific barcode marker (`value="45"`) via webcam and renders a dynamic, animated 3D cylinder anchored to that marker.

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 **Marker-based AR** using matrix barcodes (4x4) via webcam
- 🌀 **Animated 3D cylinder** with physically inspired material design
- ✅ **Marker detection status** displayed through UI feedback
- ⚡ Modular architecture: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript separated for scalability

3. Open index.html in a browser (preferably Chrome) with webcam access.
4. Show barcode marker #45 to your camera.
🎯 What You'll See- A rotating gold cylinder appears on top of the barcode marker.
- An on-screen message prompts you when the marker is not visible.
- Real-time marker tracking logs are printed in the browser console.

🌟 Customize & Extend- 💠 Replace the cylinder with <a-gltf-model> to load 3D assets
- 🎨 Modify material attributes for realistic shading
- 🔁 Add multiple markers or gesture interaction
- 📊 Integrate data overlays (e.g. thermodynamics, CFD outputs)
📷 Sample MarkerUse barcode marker value="45" from AR.js training examples.

🙌 CreditsCreated using open-source libraries and built for experimentation with marker-based AR.
